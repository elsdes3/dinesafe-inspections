    "### Objective\n",
    "To use Machine Learning (ML) to predict the liklihood of a significant or crucial infraction in establishment (restaurant, grocery store or similar) inspections conducted by the City of Toronto's DineSafe Inspection system. Data collected by the DineSafe program are obtained from the city's open data portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Facts about DineSafe Program in Toronto\n",
    "The following are facts about the data based on the city of Toronto's [Open Data Portal page for DineSafe data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/dinesafe/) and [general info page for the DineSafe program](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/food-safety/dinesafe/about-dinesafe/)\n",
    "1. A single inspection takes place on a specific date at a single establishment. An `inspection_id` should be unique for each inspection. An `establishment_id` should be unique for each establishment.\n",
    "2. An establishment chain (such as the [SUBWAY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_(restaurant)) brand), can have multiple establishment locations.\n",
    "3. Each location can be inspected one or more times (usually more than once). So, a single `establishment_id` and `inspection_id` should be associated with a single `inspection_date`.\n",
    "4. One or more infractions can be recorded per inspection. In the inspections data, each infraction is listed on a single row. There can be multiple rows (infractions) per inspection.\n",
    "5. If a Significant infraction is detected, an [inspector returns within two days](https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/health-programs-advice/food-safety/dinesafe/dinesafe-infractions/) to re-inspect (follow-up inspection) the establishment. The current ML use-case will not use such re-inspections so these inspections will be removed from the data (later in this notebook)."

    "For the current ML use-case, we require each *observation* to be an independent inspection with or without an infraction (crucial, significant or minor). We will then create a binary variable indicating whether the inspection resulted in a significant or crucial infraction (1) or not (0) since that is that label that the ML algorithm needs to predict. Significant or crucial infractions present a health hazard, while minor infractions only present minimal health risk. The ML model will not be predicting the outcome of follow-up inspections, but will only be trained to predict the outcome (if there was a significant or crucial infraction, or not) of the initial inspection.\n",

    "#### Inspection Schedule During the Out-of-Sample Period\n",
    "When an ML model is trained, before it is called to make predictions, it is assumed that the future inspection schedule (establishments and planned inspection dates) are known ahead of time. These do not need to be made available ot the inspector. However, they must be provided to a prediction service that calls the trained ML model to predict if these scheduled inspections will result in an infraction. The ML model will predict the likelohood of detecting a significant or crucial infraction will be detected during these scheduled inspections (at the scheduled establishments) *ahead of the date on which the scheduled inspection will occur*. So, (if sufficiently accurate) the ML model can predict the likelihood of a crucial or significant infraction, during a scheduled inspection, before an inspector conducts a scheduled inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Examples of Handling an Out-of-Sample Period\n",
    "In one of the previous ML-based studies, a out-of-sample period of time is pre-chosen. During this time, the inspections proceed as planned. At the end of this period, when the inspection data becomes available (establishment locations and inspection dates), the ML model is used to predict the likelihood of an infraction during those inspections. So, the ML model does not have to predict into the future since it is being evaluated against true inspection data in the past. The reason for this approach is that the the applicatoin in question was part of a pilot study to estimate the efficacy of such an approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implications for Current Work\n",
    "By comparison, in the current project and with an eye towards deploying such an ML model, we need to predict this likelihood ahead of time so that establishments with infractions are known before the day of an in-person inspection by an inspector. For this reason, we are assuming here that the inspection schedule (establishments and planned inspection dates) are known ahead of time. This also means that any predictors (ML features) we use must be known ahead of the out-of-sample period. For example, if weather is to be used then a forecast of the weather conditions (eg. temperature) during the out-of-sample period is required for dates and locations corresponding to the planned inspection schedule since we will need this weather data on the date when the predictions of all out-of-sample inspections are to be made."
